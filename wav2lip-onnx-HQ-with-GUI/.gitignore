# Model files and heavy runtimes (most ONNX/PyTorch models are large)
# IMPORTANT: All large model files (ONNX, .pt, .pth, etc.) have been removed from this repository.
# They are intentionally ignored so the git history and clones remain small.
# Download models from the Google Drive link listed in README.md and place them into one of the
# local folders below (examples used by the project): `checkpoints/` or `wav2lip_onnx_models/`.
# Keep this ignore in place unless you decide to track models using Git LFS or an external host.
*.onnx
*.onnx.zip
*.pt
*.pth

# Specific folders with models (explicit) - keep ignored
/checkpoints/*.onnx
/wav2lip_onnx_models/*.onnx
/xseg/*.onnx
/blendmasker/*.onnx
/faceID/*.onnx
/enhancers/**/models/*.onnx

# If you are using tools that put downloaded models in a 'models' folder
models/

# If you want to track the models with Git LFS instead of ignoring, remove the *.onnx rules above
# and use Git LFS to track the exact file(s):
#   git lfs install
#   git lfs track "*.onnx"
# commit the generated .gitattributes and then add the model files.

# Keep placeholder txt files and README markers (these are useful):
!**/place *_onnx model here.txt
!**/place *onnx model here.txt

# Note: models were removed from this repo and are available on the project Google Drive.
# See `README.md` for the Drive link and instructions to download and place model files.
